# Tim's News Web UI

## Background

Welcome to Tim's News front end project. This is the second of several learning projects undertaken on my journey back to the wonderful world of software development, and forms the Web UI to the earlier News API found here:

- hosted: https://tims-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api
- GitHub: https://github.com/mrtim2117/nc_news

The hosted front end application and associated React code can be found as follows:

- hosted: https://tims-nc-news.netlify.app/
- GitHub: https://github.com/mrtim2117/fe-nc-news

Note: This is a living, breathing project, with several bug fixes and enhancements to be added as time progresses.

This UI is written using React with JavaScript, employing CSS Modules as the primary styling technology, and Axios to consume the remote API asynchronously. 

Please follow the the instructions below to clone the repo, then build and test your own version.
