# Tim's News Web UI

## Background

Welcome to Tim's News front end project. This is the second of several learning projects undertaken on my journey back to the wonderful world of software development, and forms the Web UI to the earlier News API found here:

- hosted: https://tims-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api
- GitHub: https://github.com/mrtim2117/nc_news

Note: This is a living, breathing project, with several bug fixes and enhancements to be added as time progresses.
